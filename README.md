# Implement an interpreter in less than 120 minutes

In this hands-on workshop we will do a crash-course in what an interpreter is and how to implement one.

## What is an interpreter

An interpreter is a type of program that reads and executes code line-by-line or statement-by-statement. Unlike a compiler, which translates the entire source code into machine code (or bytecode) before execution, an interpreter processes the code in real-time, translating and executing it on the fly. This makes interpreted languages easier to test and debug, as you can see the effects of code immediately.

Hereâ€™s how an interpreter typically works:

1. Reads the source code: The interpreter reads the high-level programming language code.
2. Translates: It converts each statement or expression into machine-understandable actions.
3. Executes: Once translated, the interpreter executes the instruction immediately.

Examples of languages that are usually interpreted are Python, JavaScript (more or less).

## Where do we start when implementing an interpreter?

To start implementing an interpreter we need a language to implement an interpreter for. Picking a mainstream programming language would be much too complicated for a 120 minutes session.
Instead we will implement a complete interpreter for the turing-complete esoteric language [brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck).

## brainfuck!?

The brainfuck language is small, consisting of only 8 instructions but yet powerful enough to implement somewhat useful programs in. Included in this repository
is a [language specification](SPECIFICATION.md). Read it carefully when implementing an instruction.

## Let's get started!

Included in this repo is an incomplete brainfuck interpreter along with a test suite. You will implement the interpreter by filling out the missing code in the `run` function in [app.js](app.js).

To install the necessary deps and run the failing test suites:

```bash
nvm use
npm install
npm test
```

To run the interpreter on an actual file do:

```bash
node app.js examples/hello.b
```

## Implementation hints

- Use the test cases as guidance, there are test cases that only uses a subset of the instructions, make those work first!
- Start with the simple instructions: No loops and no user input!
- Then do loops!
- And finally do user input!
- `run` should be async as we can deal with user input!
- Remember the brainfuck specification!
